# External REST APIs

Bio-Node workflows can be accessed over a public REST API. For this, you have to export a workflow as an API by following these steps:

1. If you never ran the workflow in question:
    1. Create an example run in the editor
    1. Run the workflow
1. Go to the details page of the workflow you want to make accessible
1. Click <Fa-Pen title="Pen" /> next to the workflow's name
1. Select **Create API**

You will get a technical description of the API that was created. Apart from the name, the output tells you which data types were mapped to which numerical IDs.
Use the name to access your workflow as `POST {"name":"<name>"} -> https://bio-no.de/api/v1/api_workflow/run/`.
All inputs and outputs are changed to numerical IDs.

## Access Token

You can easily authenticate with the REST API using an access token. If you're a staff member, you can create tokens in the [admin panel][1]. Otherwise, a staff member has to allocate one for you.

`POST {"token":"<token>"} -> https://bio-no.de/api/token_login/` will set the necessary session cookies.

## Inputs and Outputs

To provide inputs for your workflow, upload them with the name of your API Workflow as the type, and `i/<n>` as the name. `n` starts at 1.
To download outputs from your workflow, create a download with the name of your API Workflow as the type, and `o/<n>` as the name. `n` starts at 1.

### Inputs

`POST {"name":"i/<n>"} -> https://bio-no.de/api/v1/my_upload/`.  
`PUT {"file": FILE, ...} -> https://bio-no.de/api/v1/upload/` (for the full API of file uploads, see [simple uploader][2]).  
`POST {"manual_format":"<api name>","wrap_files":false,"checkboxes":[],"suffixes":[],"types":[]}} -> https://bio-no.de/api/v1/finalize_upload/`.

### Outputs

`POST {"name":"o/<n>","type":"<api name>"} -> https://bio-no.de/api/v1/create_download/`.
