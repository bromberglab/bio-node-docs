# Resources

An important requirement for HPC scheduling is an adequate assertion of a job's required resources. In kubernetes, a job can request CPU and memory resources.
Both requests can also set a limit which may not be surpassed by the job. For more information, see kubernetes' [documentation][1].

## In Bio-Node

Every node in Bio-Node is scheduled as a job on the kubernetes cluster. Moreover, a node running in parallel creates one sub-job per run. Therefore, resource allocation is critically important for a workflow's performance.
The resource requirements are configured in a node's settings, which are pre-populated by the node's image meta labels. If no requirements are specified, the default is 100Mi\[Bytes\] for memory and 100m\[cores\] for CPU.

In addition to resource requests, limits are also added to the jobs. Limits cannot be overridden manually, they are always set to 2$\times$ the job's requests. A job requesting 200Mi memory and 150m CPU will thus be throttled when
exceeding 300m CPU and killed when exceeding 400Mi memory.
