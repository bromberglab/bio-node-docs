# Inputs & Outputs

## Single In-/Output

Just add the label `input=` to your dockerfile. Same for outputs.

## Multiple In-/Outputs

Since Dockerfile's label syntax only allows one value per label-key, and arrays are only parsed as strings, you can add multiple inputs with `input_1=<your first input>`, `input_2=<your second input>`. Same for outputs.

## Syntax

The simplest syntax for an input is just the name of its type. Let's say you're creating a node, which adds two numbers together. The syntax would be

    LABEL input_1=number
    LABEL input_2=number

::: tip
You can combine multiple labels into a single Docker build layer like this:

    LABEL input_1="number" \
          input_2="number"

:::

Inputs can be customized a lot, by adding more information to the label. The syntax is

    input="name[,arg1[,arg2[...]]]"

Making every subsequent argument optional. Only the name is required. All of this holds true for outputs as well.

## Input Arguments

| Position | Argument             | Meaning                                                                          | Default            |
| -------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| 1        | Name                 | Name of this input's type. This makes the input conform to other Nodes' outputs. | :heavy_minus_sign: |
| 2        | Flag                 | How to pass the input to the tool. Will be prepended, i.e. `-f` -> `-f <input>`  | (empty)            |
| 3        | required \| optional | Optional parameters may be missing.                                              | required           |
| 4        | filename \| content  | Set to `content` if the tool does not take filenames as inputs.                  | filename           |
| 5        | Filename             | Since Bio Node works on folder-inputs, you can specify a single filename here.   | (empty)            |

### Filenames

If you specify a filename, your tool will always be run with `<job-folder>/<filename>` as the run parameter.

Otherwise, since most tools run on single files, Bio Node will try to find a single file inside each folder and use it as input.
If you want to disable this behavior, set a file name manually. Folders that don't contain one file (so either many, or zero)
cannot be inferred. In this case, the folder-name is used as the run argument.

Using the foldername as the input even though it only contains one file is not supported. You can work around this limitation
by setting the filename to `/`, resulting in `<job-folder>//` which linux usually interprets as `<job-folder>/`.

## Example Image with In- & Outputs

We'll assume that `add` produces the resulting number inside `resulting_file.txt`, which is the output we're looking for.
It also prints more verbose output of the summation (`1+2=3`) to stdout. We want to keep that as well.
Lastly, if any errors occurred, there might be log files that were created in the working directory. We'll keep them as
our last output.

    # Your image needs to have /bin/sh installed.
    # i.e. alpine, ubuntu, ...
    FROM alpine

    # < commands to build your image >

    ENTRYPOINT ["add"]
    # Example produces 1+2=3
    CMD ["1", "2"]

    # ↓ Bio Node config below ↓
    LABEL bio-node="v1.0" \
        output_1="number,workingdir,resulting_file.txt" \
        output_2="log file,stdout,output.log" \
        output_3="error logs,workingdir" \
        input_1="number,,required,content" \
        input_2="number,,required,content"
