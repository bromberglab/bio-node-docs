# Deployment

Adding a Docker image to Bio Node.

## GCR push

Every image inside the project's Google Container Registry is automatically included in Bio Node's Node list.
Pushing anything to GCR will trigger a webhook that fetches all images and updates the metadata.
Our google project id is `poised-cortex-254814`, so all images should be tagged `gcr.io/poised-cortex-254814/<image>`.
Once your google account has been authenticated with the GCloud project, you can push your image like this:

```bash
# install docker
# install gcloud sdk (see below)
# then:
gcloud auth login
gcloud auth configure-docker
docker pull <image> # or docker build -t <image> .
docker tag <image> gcr.io/poised-cortex-254814/<image>
docker push gcr.io/poised-cortex-254814/<image>
```

Your Node should show up in the dock within one minute.

### Installing the GCloud SDK

Either follow [these][1] instructions, or run

```bash
export CLOUDSDK_CORE_DISABLE_PROMPTS=1
curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash
source ~/google-cloud-sdk/path.bash.inc
gcloud --quiet components update
```

## Import

Importing from Docker Hub is possible through the images tab. After clicking 'import', fill in the name of your image, specify the tag and start the process. Your image will begin loading and shows up once the import has been completed.

Examples for importing images:

-   No registry: (Docker Hub)
    -   bromberglab/funtrp
    -   bromberglab/funtrp : latest (inferred)
    -   bromberglab/funtrp : stable
-   With registry:
    -   registry.hub.docker.com/bromberglab/funtrp (same as the above)
    -   Third party: (repo must be public)
        -   docker-registry.genouest.org/bioinfo/mmseq
    -   GCR: (import has full access to the local registry)
        -   gcr.io/poised-cortex-254814/mifaser
