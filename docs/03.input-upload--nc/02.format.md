# Job Format

Bio-Node uploads are in the structure

```
Upload
├── job1
│   ├── optional_file.txt
│   └── required_file.txt
└── job2
    └── required_file.txt
```

This way different jobs can be split to be run on multiple nodes.
A single node will be running on one of those inputs:

```
Node 1
└── input
    └── job1
        ├── optional_file.txt
        └── required_file.txt
Node 2
└── input
    └── job2
        └── required_file.txt
```

Your folder structure is detected automatically to be translated into this format. If your format could not be detected, however, or you want to customize your own folder structure, you can choose to upload data with [Manual Format][1].

Automatic detection tries to find reoccurring filename bases. Folders are assumed to belong to a single job.
An upload may be wrapped in a folder, or wrapped recursively. `<folder>/<folder>/<folder>/files` is processed the same as `files`
(as long as the parent folders contain exactly one element).

## Example Upload Format

```
Upload
└── files  // this folder is unwrapped automatically
    ├── job_1
    │   ├── additional
    │   └── files
    ├── job_1 main.csv
    ├── job_1_meta.txt
    ├── job_2
    │   ├── additional
    │   └── files
    ├── job_2 main.csv
    ├── job_2_meta.txt
    ├── job_3
    │   ├── additional
    │   └── files
    ├── job_3 main.csv
    └── job_3_meta.txt
```

Will translate to:

```
Upload
├── <job> main.csv
├── <job>_meta.txt
└── <job>
    ├── additional
    └── files
```

A Node will run on:

```
Input
└── job_1.job
    ├── file main.csv
    ├── file_meta.txt
    ├── additional
    └── files
```
