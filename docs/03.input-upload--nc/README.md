# Uploads

Inputs for Bio-Node jobs are uploaded through the web interface. Folders and files are supported. The uploaded inputs can be processed in two different ways: [Jobs or Static][1].

## Archive Extraction

If your upload consists of archives only, no other files or folders, you can extract them in a preprocessing step. You will be prompted before the format detection.

Currently supported archive formats:

-   `*.tar.gz`

[1]: /static_upload/
