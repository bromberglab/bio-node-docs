# Manual Upload Formatting

This feature disables automatic [job format][2] detection.

With manual format, make sure that your upload contains the exact structure of `<job>/<files>`, with no parent folders. This is **not** supported: `my_upload/<job>/<files>`.

For [static][1] files, manual formatting is easier. Since a static input is defined by containing exactly one job, your data will be packed into a single job-folder for you. If you don't wish to enable that feature, you can enable "unwrapping".

## Unwrapping a single folder

> Only for static uploads.

For static uploads, all files still have to be packed into a single folder. Even though static inputs do not have _jobs_, they still need to conform to Bio-Node's structure.
Because of this, static uploads are wrapped into a static folder by default. If your upload already consists of a single folder, you can choose if you want that folder unwrapped or not. Here are the two scenarios for a node with one static input: (as its second input)

```
Upload
└── my static input
    ├── some_file.csv
    └── another_file.db


Keep Folder (default)
=====================

/input/2
└── static
    └── my static input
        ├── some_file.csv
        └── another_file.db

$ ls $input_2
> /input/2/static:
>
>   my static input/



Unwrap Folder
=============

/input/2
└── static
    ├── some_file.csv
    └── another_file.db

$ ls $input_2
> /input/2/static:
>
>   some_file.csv
>   another_file.db
```
