# Jobs or Static

When uploading an input, you can switch between two modes:

## Jobs (default)

Your upload contains one or more jobs to be processed in parallel or in sequence. Bio-Node tries to find a structure in your upload to automatically split the files into jobs. If that detection fails, you can always use [manual][1] uploads. For the details of format detection, see [Job Format][2].

## Static

You're uploading a static input, exactly one job. This corresponds to the static input mode. Job detection is disabled. Beware of [Unpacking][3].
